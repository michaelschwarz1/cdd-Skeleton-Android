# cdd-Skeleton-Android
Within this Open Source Project, a Android application will be created to support community driven development (cdd) for games. The basic idea is to create a shell for a Game that deals with the response from the community during development cycle. 

(Goal for the first Setup)
- The Game is addes as a standalone Module and developed in Unity
- The Web-Page is a React App deploied on GitHub Pages
- Live programming sessions is streamed on Youtube and Twitch
- The App allows the community to play the game, place new ideas and vote for customizations

It's still under construction, so please don't expect too much.
